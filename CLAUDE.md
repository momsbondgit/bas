## Recent Changes

### Feature: "From:" Prefix for Confession Card Headers
**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Purpose**: Enhanced user experience by adding clear attribution to confession posts

#### What was implemented:
1. **ConfessionCard Widget Updates**:
   - Added `isCurrentUser` parameter to distinguish current user's posts
   - Implemented `_getHeaderText()` method with conditional logic:
     - Current user posts: "From: You"
     - Bot posts: "From: [bot name]" 
     - Other posts: "From: [generated nickname]"
   - Added missing `_nicknames` list with 40 female names for consistent nickname generation

2. **GirlMeetsCollegeScreen Updates**:
   - Modified `_buildConfessionCard()` to accept `isCurrentUser` parameter
   - Updated `_buildPostWidgets()` to identify current user posts in the general feed
   - Enhanced `_buildActiveUserPostView()` to pass `isCurrentUser: true` for real user posts

#### Why this was needed:
- **User Clarity**: Users needed clear identification of their own posts vs others
- **Bot Identification**: Bot posts should show the bot's actual name, not a generic nickname
- **Consistency**: All posts now follow a standardized "From: [name]" format
- **UX Improvement**: Removes ambiguity about post authorship in the queue system

#### Development principles applied:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each method has one clear purpose
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Centralized header logic prevents duplication
- **Clean Code**: Simple, readable implementation with descriptive names
- **Maintainability**: Easy to extend for future user types or display formats

#### Files modified:
- `lib/ui/widgets/confession_card.dart`: Core widget logic
- `lib/ui/screens/girl_meets_college_screen.dart`: Integration with queue system

#### Testing:
- App compiles successfully without errors
- Feature integrates properly with existing queue and bot systems
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing post display logic

## Development Guidelines

When working on this codebase:

1. **Always follow clean code principles** - prefer simple, readable solutions
2. **Test changes thoroughly** - ensure no regressions in existing functionality  
3. **Document significant changes** - update this file when adding new features
4. **Consider the queue system** - most UI changes interact with the user queue logic
5. **Maintain consistency** - follow existing patterns and naming conventions
