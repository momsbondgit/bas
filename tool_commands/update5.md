# **Task: Implement Admin Metrics Tracking**

## 1. Base Metrics (Compass Points)

### **North – Belonging Proof**

* **Metric:** D+1 Return Rate ≥ 50%
* **Check:** Did users feel continuity?

  * Same table, same cast, not reshuffled.

---

### **East – Flow Working**

* **Metric:** Session Completion Rate ≥ 80%
* **Check:** Did users feel rhythm?

  * Session followed clear flow: start → middle → goodbye → “see you tomorrow.”

---

### **South – Voice / Recognition**

* **Metric:** Posts per real user ≥ 1
* **Check:** Did users feel seen?

  * Every user got their turn and their words landed in the group.

---

### **West – Affection / Resonance**

* **Metric:** Track total reactions made by real users + how many times each user reacted.
* **Check:** Did users feel emotional response?

  * User engaged with laughter, empathy, or spice from the table.

---

## 2. Goal

* Implement these metrics so they are **tracked and displayed in the admin interface**.
* Each compass point should show both:

  1. The **metric value**.
  2. The **return desire check** (qualitative meaning).
