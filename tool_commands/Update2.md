# **AI Agent Task: Update Reactions System**

## Current Behavior

* Reactions are static buttons that users tap.

## Required Update

* Replace static buttons with a **live reaction stream**.

### New Reaction Features

1. **Typed Reactions**

   * Users can type a custom reaction (max 50 characters).

2. **Live Stream Feed**

   * After a post is made, reactions appear directly under it in a **scrolling live feed**.
   * Waiting users can type and send reactions in real time.

3. **Behavior Similar to Bye Popup**

   * Reactions should display like the live chat in the **Bye Popup** at session end:

     * Messages fade in/out smoothly.
     * Multiple users can react at once.

---

## Goal

* Replace static reaction buttons with a **dynamic, typed reaction stream** under each post.
* Create a more interactive and real-time experience for waiting users.
