1. **Clean out old builds**
   First, clear away any old Flutter build files so youâ€™re starting fresh.

2. **Make a new build without a service worker**
   Build your Flutter web app in release mode, but turn off the service worker. This stops browsers from caching an old version of your site.

3. **Copy that build into new  branch**
   create a new branch where we are going to copy the new web build 

4. **Add your custom domain (if you use one)**
   make sure we dont forget our logos and our custom domain. 

5. **Commit and push to GitHub**
   Save and push the changes in the `new branch` branch so they go live.
