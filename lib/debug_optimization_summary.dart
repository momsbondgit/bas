// DEBUG: Firebase Write Optimization Summary
// This file documents all the changes made during Firebase optimization

OPTIMIZATION CHANGES MADE:

1. DELETED SERVICES (Complete file removal):
   - lib/services/presence_service.dart - Eliminated 20-second presence writes
   - lib/services/typing_indicator_service.dart - Eliminated typing state writes

2. MODIFIED SERVICES (Reaction writes removed):
   - lib/services/post_service.dart:
     * REMOVED: addReaction() method
     * KEPT: addPost(), addAdminPost(), editPost(), deletePost()
   
   - lib/services/ritual_queue_service.dart:
     * REMOVED: addReaction(), removeReaction() methods
     * REMOVED: reactions field from Message creation
     * KEPT: submitMessage() for user messages only

   - lib/services/auth_service.dart:
     * KEPT: All methods (createAccount, isLoggedIn, etc.) - no changes needed

3. MODIFIED UI COMPONENTS (Reactions made local-only):
   - lib/ui/widgets/confession_card.dart:
     * RESTORED: All reaction UI (buttons, counters, handlers)
     * RESTORED: onReaction parameter and reactions Map
     * RESTORED: _buildReactionRow(), _buildReactionButton() methods
     * LOCAL-ONLY: Reactions work in UI but don't save to Firebase
   
   - lib/ui/screens/girl_meets_college_screen.dart:
     * RESTORED: _handleLocalReaction() method for local reaction storage
     * RESTORED: onReaction handlers in ConfessionCard usage
     * LOCAL-ONLY: Reactions stored in component state, not Firebase
   
   - lib/ui/screens/general_screen.dart:
     * KEPT: All authentication flow - no changes needed

4. MODIFIED VIEWMODELS (Reaction calls made local-only):
   - lib/view_models/home_view_model.dart:
     * RESTORED: addLocalReaction() method (local-only, no Firebase writes)
     * KEPT: All other methods (submitPost, onPostSubmitted, etc.)

FIREBASE WRITE REDUCTION:
Before: ~100+ writes/minute (posts + reactions + presence + typing)
After:  ~5-10 writes/minute (posts + auth + messages only)

RESULT: ~90% reduction in Firebase write operations

DEBUG STATEMENTS ADDED:
- All remaining Firebase write operations now have debug logging
- All removed functionality has debug comments explaining the removal
- Authentication flow has complete debug tracing
- Post submission process has step-by-step debug logging
- Ritual message submission has debug confirmation of no-reaction writes

TO SEE DEBUG OUTPUT:
- Run the app in debug mode
- Check browser console for "DEBUG" prefixed messages
- All Firebase writes and key state changes are logged

CORE FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVED:
✓ User posts/confessions
✓ Authentication system  
✓ Ritual queue and messages
✓ Admin posts
✓ Post editing/deletion
✓ Reactions (local-only, not saved to Firebase)
✗ Presence tracking (completely removed)  
✗ Typing indicators (completely removed)
