**Task:**
Open `<file>` and review its contents.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify Repetitive Logic**

   * Check if there are any repeated code blocks or logic patterns.
   * If so, condense them into a single reusable function.
   * Make sure this change does **not** alter or break the fileâ€™s **public API**.

2. **Refactor Only If Needed**

   * If repetitive logic exists â†’ refactor.
   * If the code is already clean â†’ keep it unchanged.

3. **Simplify Aggressively**

   * Delete any code that is unnecessary, redundant, or overly complex.
   * Prioritize **simplicity** and **minimalism** above all else.

**Constraints:**

* Do **not** modify the fileâ€™s public API.
* Only refactor when absolutely necessary.
* Final output should be the **simplest possible version** of the file that maintains the same functionality.
