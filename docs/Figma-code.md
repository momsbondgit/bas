Prompt (rewritten for clarity):
Use the provided Figma frame and reference image to design the text layout.

Figma Frame: 
Purpose: Copy the general style guide — fonts, colors, and overall theme.
Do not copy exact positions or sizes.

Reference Image
Purpose: Use this image to decide placement and sizing of the text elements.
This determines layout, not styling.

Final Output:
Apply Figma’s fonts, colors, and styles.
Place and size elements inspired by the reference image.
Goal: Make it look balanced and good, not pixel-perfect.


Make sure you ask quesitons if you do not have access to something, or you have a question about something. there should be no roome for assumptoins.

How im doing this is im going to give you different verions of the same figma design and as we progress and make changes each new version adds more things of which we need to implment. we did it this way so that we can focus on one part of the design at a time.
