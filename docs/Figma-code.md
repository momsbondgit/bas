Figma Frame: 
Link: Figma Screen; https://www.figma.com/design/Az2vvD44DMPZSNkZa5QQJP/Being-actually-social?node-id=332-184&t=KrYSB8RN55ZSHVd8-4
Purpose: Copy the general style guide — fonts, colors, and overall theme.
Do not copy exact positions or sizes.

Reference Image ![Alt text](<Screen two-2.png>)
Purpose: Use this image to decide placement and sizing of the text elements.
This determines layout, not styling.

Final Output:
Apply Figma’s fonts, colors, and styles.
Place and size elements inspired by the reference image.
Goal: Make it look balanced and good, not pixel-perfect.
